# General Project Directions

## Collaboration Policy

Students may optionally work in groups of two.

Policies for partners
* a comment at top should specify your partner by their @wisc.edu email
* both partners submit separately
* it's OK for the submissions of two partners to either be identical or different
* it's NOT OK to submit code from your partner that you didn't help write or understand

Policies for other collaboration
* a comment at the top should list people you talked to or collaborated with (no need to list course staff) by their @wisc.edu email
* you can talk about logic and help each other debug
* no code copying: no emailing code (or similar), no photos of code, no looking at code and typing it line by line
* copying code then changing it is still copying and thus not allowed

## Submission

You'll be doing all your work on GitHub classroom.  Watch for Canvas
announcements providing project invite links.
